## Vacation Destination  

Bases on the data we gathered, we are able to provide our customers countries to vacation in based on the temperatures they decide appropriate.
Once they let us know the temperatures they prefer, we can locate countries which will accommodate those requests. 
From there, they can pick a specific country that sounds like it would be a great vacation spot. Once they provide us a country that they are interested in, we can find four cities that are close by and suggest hotels that are in those cities so they can build an itinerary.
